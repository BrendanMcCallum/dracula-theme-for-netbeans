## Supported languages
- Java
- HTML
- XML
- JavaScript
 
## Installation instructions
1. Copy the `config` directory to `~/.netbeans/XX.X`, replacing `XX.X` with the Netbeans version being used.
2. Start Netbeans.
3. Access editor color settings via `Tools > Options > Fonts & Colors`
4. Select `Dracula` from the `Profile` drop down menu.

The Dracula for Netbeans looks best when combined with [Darcula LAF](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/62424/darcula-laf-for-netbeans).

## Contribute
Netbeans supports many languages so any help adapting the Dracula to more languages is welcome.
